   Polynomial interpolation is the interpolation of a given data set by a 
[polynomial](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polynomial): given some points, find 
a polynomial which goes exactly through these points.

## Numerical Stability
 
Numerical stability refers to how a malformed input affects the execution of an 
algorithm. In a numerically stable algorithm, errors in the input lessen in 
significance as the algorithm executes, having little effect on the final 
output.

On the other hand, in a numerically unstable algorithm, errors in the input 
cause a considerably larger error in the final output.

## TODO

- Newton's form (using divided differences)
- De Casteljau's algorithm
