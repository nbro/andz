# Description

In this file, you can find some functions that return the nth fibonacci number,
but they do it in different ways, which has also an impact on the performance
and asymptotic complexity of the same algorithms.

The Fibonacci numbers is an infinite sequence of numbers, where the next
element of the sequence is constructed by summing the previous two elements of
the same.

The first two elements are (usually) 0 and 1, so the next element is 1, so the
sequence is now {0, 1, 1}. We then add 1 + 1 = 2 to obtain the 4th element of
the sequence, which is now {0, 1, 1, 2}, and so on.

The nth Fibonacci number can thus be computed in a recursive way. First, the
base cases are when n = 0 and n = 1, so fib(0) = 0 and fib(1) = 1. The
inductive case is fib(n) = fib(n - 1) + fib(n - 2).

It turns out that, if we compute the nth Fibonacci number in this way, we would
repeat some computations. For example, to compute fib(5), you would need to
compute fib(4) and fib(3). To compute fib(4), we would need to compute fib(3)
and fib(2). So, we would compute fib(3) twice.

To solve this problem, once we compute fib(3), we can save the result. This is
called memoization.

The time complexity of memoized_fibonacci (below) is linear because we need
to solve all fib(i), from i=0 to i=n, and each of these sub-problems takes
constant time.
